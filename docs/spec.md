### v1 stable contract

The `1.0.0` specification document records the stable core specification. `@sdif 1.0` identifies the stable core syntax and semantic contract. The package version may advance independently from the document format version.

Core v1 behavior includes parsing, the reference AST shape, schema-driven validation, canonical-syntax-v1, safe default policies, local includes behind explicit policy, and `.sdif.ai` reversibility to canonical source. Versioned or not-yet-implemented extensions include remote includes, remote schemas, complex namespaces, deep graph validation, digital signatures, advanced type unions, semantic numeric/date normalization, and non-declarative rule execution.

This document defines an initial public technical specification for SDIF, a compact semantic data interchange format designed for AI agents and deterministic machine workflows, with human-auditable source files.

SDIF is not intended to universally replace JSON, YAML, TOML, CSV, Markdown, RDF, or other data formats. Its purpose is narrower: to represent structured, semantic, verifiable, and token-efficient documents in a way that agents and tools can process directly while humans can audit the source when needed.

---

## 1. Executive summary

SDIF is a textual format for representing structured data, semantic relationships, declarative rules, validation evidence, and bounded narrative context.

It combines several ideas:

* The strict structural model of JSON.
* The readability of YAML and TOML.
* The tabular compactness of CSV and token-efficient formats.
* The graph-like expressiveness of semantic triples.
* The bounded narrative capability of Markdown-style text blocks.
* The determinism required for canonicalization, hashing, signing, and reproducible validation.

The primary goal of SDIF is to maximize **semantic density per token** without sacrificing clarity, validation, or safety.

A compact summary:

```text
SDIF = structured data + compact tables + semantic relations + declarative rules + canonical form
```

---

## 2. Goals

SDIF should:

1. Be directly useful to AI agents and deterministic machine workflows.
2. Be efficient for AI models to process.
3. Be deterministic to parse.
4. Be validatable through schemas.
5. Be canonicalizable.
6. Support stable hashing, with signing layered over canonical bytes by external tooling.
7. Represent scalar data, objects, lists, tables, relations, rules, and narrative blocks.
8. Avoid unnecessary repetition, especially in uniform arrays of objects.
9. Support auditable source files and machine-normalized canonical files.
10. Remain implementation-friendly and portable.

---

## 3. Non-goals

SDIF does not aim to:

1. Become a general-purpose programming language.
2. Execute arbitrary code.
3. Replace SQL.
4. Replace full RDF or OWL.
5. Replace Markdown for long-form prose.
6. Replace JSON for existing public APIs where JSON is already the expected contract.
7. Allow highly flexible syntax at the cost of ambiguity.
8. Optimize aesthetics over deterministic processing.
9. Be tied to a specific product, operating system, vendor, or project.
10. Be exclusively an AI-only format.

---

## 4. Design principles

### 4.1 Semantic density per token

SDIF should avoid verbose patterns when a more compact representation preserves the same meaning.

Verbose representation:

```json
[
  { "id": "R1", "status": "done", "gate": "verify" },
  { "id": "R2", "status": "pending", "gate": "verify" }
]
```

SDIF representation:

```sdif
milestones[id,status,gate]:
  R1	done	verify
  R2	pending	verify
```

The table header defines the shape once. Each row then carries only values. Table columns are separated by the horizontal tab character (`HTAB`, U+0009), not by comma or ordinary space.

This avoids conflicts with natural-language text, localized decimal notation, quoted phrases, and comma-rich content.

For the token-optimized `.sdif.ai` projection, table rows may omit the canonical
two-space indentation when the row contains at least one `HTAB`. Canonical SDIF
source still emits indented rows for review stability.

`.sdif.ai` may include an alias header immediately after the `@sdif.ai`
directive. The header maps compact names back to semantic names without using a
JSON sidecar:

```sdif
@sdif.ai 1.0
alias[k=kind,st=status]
k Plan
```

`.sdif.ai` may also suffix a table column name with `$` to mark the column as
string-preserved. In such a column, cells are decoded as strings even when the
cell text looks like `null`, `true`, `false`, or a number. This avoids repeating
quotes on scalar-like string-heavy columns while preserving JSON-equivalent
semantics.

```sdif
@sdif.ai 1.0
checks[id,value$]:
C1	null
C2	42
```

### 4.2 Schema-first

Every serious SDIF document should declare a schema.

```sdif
schema example.plan.v1
```

A parser may read SDIF without a schema, but a validator should not treat an unschematized document as fully reliable.

### 4.3 Semantics over shape

SDIF does not only describe data shape. It can also describe meaning.

```sdif
rel:
  release.v2 depends_on release.v1
  release.v2 validated_by validation.report.v2
```

Relationships are first-class citizens of the format.

### 4.4 Canonicalizable by design

Every valid SDIF document should be convertible into a unique canonical representation.

The canonical form removes comments, stylistic variation, non-essential whitespace, and ambiguous ordering where v1 defines a deterministic policy. It does not perform semantic equivalence normalization for numbers, dates, aliases, or vocabularies in the current reference implementation.

### 4.5 Auditable source, machine truth

The `.sdif` profile is intended for agent/tool authoring with human auditability. It is not optimized for casual copy-paste in environments that rewrite tabs. The `.sdif.canon` profile is intended for reproducible validation, hashing, signing, and machine comparison.

### 4.6 AI views are projections, not authority

The `.sdif.ai` profile may use stronger compaction and aliases to reduce token cost, but it should be treated as a derived view unless explicitly signed as an artifact in its own right.

### 4.7 No hidden magic

Aliases, relation predicates, rule functions, required fields, lifecycle states, and validation behavior must be defined by a schema, vocabulary, or local declaration.

### 4.8 Safe by default

SDIF must not execute code. Declarative rules describe validation conditions or policies, not arbitrary procedures.

---

## 5. Main use cases

SDIF is suitable for:

1. Semantic registries.
2. Structured technical plans.
3. Policy documents.
4. Interface contracts.
5. Validation reports.
6. Evidence manifests.
7. Decision records.
8. Capability manifests.
9. Knowledge indexes.
10. Agent-to-agent data exchange.
11. Compact representation of repeated structured data.
12. Auditable metadata catalogs.
13. Governance-ready configuration.
14. Documentation indexes.
15. Hybrid data/prose technical documents.

SDIF is not ideal for:

1. Large binary blobs.
2. Very large numerical datasets.
3. High-frequency telemetry streams.
4. Long literary documents.
5. Extremely simple configuration where TOML or JSON is enough.
6. Public API contracts that already require JSON compatibility.

---

## 6. Format profiles

SDIF defines three primary profiles.

### 6.1 SDIF Source

Recommended extension:

```text
.sdif
```

The source profile is optimized for compact agent/tool authoring with human auditability.

It may include:

* Comments.
* Blank lines.
* Reasonable ordering flexibility.
* Narrative blocks.
* Declared aliases.
* Tables.
* Relations.
* Declarative rules.

Example:

```sdif
@sdif 1.0
kind Plan
id release.v2.plan
schema example.plan.v1

# Human-readable title.
title "Release v2 validation plan"
status open
priority P0
```

### 6.2 SDIF Canonical

Recommended extension:

```text
.sdif.canon
```

The canonical profile is optimized for machines.

It must be:

* Comment-free.
* Deterministically ordered.
* Normalized for whitespace and line endings.
* Normalized for scalar representation.
* Suitable for hashing.
* Suitable for signing.
* Suitable for byte-for-byte comparison.

### 6.3 SDIF AI View

Recommended extension:

```text
.sdif.ai
```

The AI view is optimized for compact model input.

It may include:

* Declared aliases.
* More compact field names.
* Omitted fields when schema defaults are known.
* Table-first representation.
* Ordering optimized for incremental understanding.

Example:

```sdif
@sdif.ai 1.0
alias[k=kind,a=authority,l=lifecycle,st=status,vby=validated_by]

k Plan
id release.v2
a Canonical
l Active
st open

m[id,st,g,e]:
  R1	done	validate-schema	reports/schema.md
  R2	pending	validate-semantics	reports/semantics.md
```

The AI view should normally be generated from source or canonical SDIF, not manually treated as the authoritative source.

Generated `.sdif.ai` may use compact table rows without indentation:

```sdif
@sdif.ai 1.0
k Plan
m[id,st,g,e]:
R1	done	validate-schema	reports/schema.md
R2	pending	validate-semantics	reports/semantics.md
```

---

## 7. Core data model

An SDIF document is composed of:

1. Directives.
2. Scalar fields.
3. Objects.
4. Lists.
5. Tables.
6. Relations.
7. Declarative rules.
8. Narrative blocks.
9. Comments.

The current Python reference AST is intentionally small: parsed scalar values, inline list literals, table cells, and relation objects are stored as strings plus quote-preservation metadata where needed. Schema validation and JSON conversion perform type interpretation after parsing.

### 7.1 Document

An SDIF document is an ordered sequence of statements.

A statement may be:

* A directive.
* A scalar field.
* An object block.
* A table block.
* A relation block.
* A rule block.
* A narrative block.
* A comment.

### 7.2 Directives

Directives begin with `@`.

```sdif
@sdif 1.0
@profile source
@vocab example.core.v1
```

Initial reserved directives:

| Directive    | Meaning                                                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@sdif`      | Declares the SDIF format version.                           |
| `@sdif.ai`   | Declares the token-optimized SDIF AI projection.            |
| `@profile`   | Declares the document profile.                              |
| `@vocab`     | Declares a vocabulary.                                      |
| `@base`      | Declares a base URI or semantic namespace.                  |
| `@namespace` | Declares a namespace prefix.                                |
| `@include`   | Includes another local document or vocabulary if explicitly permitted by parser policy. |

The `@include` directive is disabled by default in the Python reference parser and must be enabled with explicit local path allowlists. Remote includes and remote schemas are reserved extension surfaces and are rejected by the current reference implementation even when experimental CLI flags are present.

### 7.3 Scalar fields

A scalar field has the form:

```sdif
key value
```

Examples:

```sdif
status open
priority P0
created_at 2026-05-20T18:00:00Z
active true
```

### 7.4 Objects

Objects use indentation.

```sdif
owner:
  id team.platform
  role maintainer
  authority Canonical
```

### 7.5 Lists

Inline list:

```sdif
tags [registry,validation,release]
```

Block-list-compatible source syntax is represented in the current AST as an object block containing repeated `-` scalar fields, and the schema validator recognizes that shape for `List<T>` fields:

```sdif
tags:
  - registry
  - validation
  - release
```

Inline lists remain scalar field values in the parser AST; JSON conversion and validation interpret them after parsing.

### 7.6 Tables

Tables represent uniform arrays of objects.

```sdif
items[id,name,status]:
  item.1	First item	open
  item.2	Second item	closed
```

This is semantically equivalent to:

```json
{
  "items": [
    { "id": "item.1", "name": "First item", "status": "open" },
    { "id": "item.2", "name": "Second item", "status": "closed" }
  ]
}
```

Tables are central to SDIF's token efficiency.

Table rows use `HTAB` as the column separator. Spaces, commas, quote marks, and localized decimal separators are data, not delimiters.

```sdif
budget[id,item,cost,tax_rate]:
  IT01	server load	450,25	21,0
  IT02	api calls	120,00	10,5
  IT03	storage fees	85,50	21,0
```

In strict mode, a tab inside a cell must be escaped as `\t` or represented through a narrative block or external reference.

### 7.7 Relations

Relations are expressed as triples:

```sdif
rel:
  subject predicate object
```

Example:

```sdif
rel:
  release.v2 depends_on release.v1
  release.v2 validated_by validation.report.v2
  validation.report.v2 emits reports/validation.md
```

A predicate must be allowed by the declared schema or vocabulary.

### 7.8 Declarative rules

Rules use compact parenthesized expressions.

```sdif
rules:
  (deny missing(evidence))
  (deny dangling(rel))
  (warn eq(authority,Unknown))
```

Rules are not executable code. They are declarative expressions interpreted by a validator with an explicit allowlist of rule functions.

### 7.9 Narrative blocks

Narrative blocks use triple quotes.

```sdif
intent """
Define the validation requirements for the next release.
The document should remain auditable and reproducible.
"""
```

Narrative blocks are useful for intent, rationale, notes, acceptance criteria, and other bounded human context.

#### 7.9.1 Nested Narratives

Narrative blocks may be nested within object blocks. A nested narrative block closes with the triple-quote delimiter `"""` aligned at the exact same indentation level where it opened. Body lines within the narrative block are normalized by removing the indentation prefix corresponding to the opening line's indentation level.

Example:

```sdif
owner:
  id team.platform
  notes """
  This note belongs to owner.
  It is nested, but canonicalizable.
  """
```

In the example above, the indentation level is 2 spaces. The closing delimiter `"""` is aligned at 2 spaces. During parsing, up to 2 spaces of indentation prefix are stripped from each body line of the narrative, yielding the semantic content:

```text
This note belongs to owner.
It is nested, but canonicalizable.
```

### 7.10 Comments

Comments begin with `#`.

```sdif
# Source-only comment.
status open
```

Comments are allowed in SDIF Source but must be removed from SDIF Canonical.

---

## 8. Type system

The v1 schema validator recognizes these base types after parsing; the parser itself preserves scalar text rather than constructing typed value nodes:

| Type       | Example                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------- |
| Null       | `null`                     |
| Boolean    | `true`, `false`            |
| Integer    | `42`                       |
| Decimal    | `10.75`                    |
| String     | `"hello world"`            |
| Identifier | `release.v2`               |
| Path       | `reports/validation.md`    |
| Date       | `2026-05-20`               |
| DateTime   | `2026-05-20T18:30:00Z`     |
| Duration   | `PT15M`                    |
| List       | `[a,b,c]`                  |
| Object     | indented block             |
| Table      | `items[id,name]:`          |
| Relation   | `subject predicate object` |
| Expression | `(deny missing(evidence))` |

### 8.1 Boolean

Only the following boolean literals are allowed:

```sdif
true
false
```

Values such as `yes`, `no`, `on`, `off`, `1`, and `0` must not be treated as booleans in the core format.

### 8.2 Numbers

Integers:

```sdif
count 42
```

Decimals:

```sdif
amount 10.75
```

Scientific notation is reserved for a future typed-normalization profile. The current reference parser preserves it as text, and the v1 schema validator does not treat it as `Decimal`:

```sdif
ratio 1.2e-5
```

Canonicalization preserves numeric spelling; semantic numeric normalization is a future versioned policy.

### 8.3 Strings

Outside tables, a value may be unquoted only if it is a safe identifier, reserved literal, number, date, datetime, duration, or list.

Strings with spaces or special characters must be quoted in scalar fields.

```sdif
status open
title "Release v2 validation plan"
label "Revenue, monthly"
```

Inside table cells, spaces, commas, quote marks, and localized decimal commas are part of the cell value because columns are separated by `HTAB`.

```sdif
items[id,label,amount]:
  item.1	Revenue, monthly	450,25
  item.2	"quoted label"	120,00
```

A table cell only requires escaping when it must contain the actual tab character, a line break, or another control character reserved by the table grammar.

Multiline strings use triple quotes outside tables.

```sdif
summary """
This is a multiline narrative block.
Line breaks are preserved.
"""
```

#### Quoted scalar constraints

A quoted scalar field outside tables must satisfy two constraints:

1. **Single-line closure.** The closing `"` must appear on the same logical line as the opening `"`. A quoted scalar that reaches end-of-line without a closing quote is a parse error (`SDIF_STRING_UNCLOSED`).
2. **No trailing content.** No non-whitespace, non-comment characters may appear after the closing `"` on the same line. Trailing content is a parse error (`SDIF_STRING_TRAILING`).

```sdif
title "valid value"          # OK
title "unclosed              # SDIF_STRING_UNCLOSED — no closing quote
title "hello" trailing       # SDIF_STRING_TRAILING — content after close
```

### 8.4 Identifiers

A safe identifier may contain:

* ASCII letters.
* Digits.
* `_`.
* `-`.
* `.`.
* `/` for controlled paths.
* `:` only when permitted by schema or namespace policy.

Examples:

```sdif
id release.v2.plan
schema example.plan.v1
path reports/validation/latest.md
```

### 8.5 Dates and times

Dates use ISO-style format:

```sdif
date 2026-05-20
```

Date-time values use ISO 8601 style:

```sdif
created_at 2026-05-20T18:30:00Z
```

Durations should use ISO 8601 duration notation:

```sdif
timeout PT30S
retention P90D
```

---

## 9. Lexical rules

### 9.1 Encoding

All SDIF documents must be UTF-8 encoded.

A UTF-8 BOM may be accepted in tolerant mode, but it must be removed in canonical form.

### 9.2 Line endings

Parsers may accept LF or CRLF.

Canonical SDIF must use LF.

### 9.3 Whitespace

The recommended indentation is two spaces.

Tabs must not be used for indentation in strict mode.

The horizontal tab character (`HTAB`, U+0009) is reserved as the column separator inside table rows.

This produces a simple rule:

1. Spaces define indentation and may appear inside table cell values.
2. Tabs separate table columns.
3. Tabs do not indent SDIF blocks.

### 9.4 Comments

A comment begins with `#` outside strings and multiline blocks.

```sdif
# comment
status open # inline comment
```

Inline comments are allowed in source, but they may be prohibited inside tables for parser simplicity and canonical stability. For the v1.0 stabilization track, strict mode prohibits inline comments inside table rows.

### 9.5 Reserved literals

Initial reserved literals:

```text
null
true
false
rel
rules
alias
schema
kind
id
```

Reserved words may be used as values when unambiguous, but their use as keys may be restricted by schema.

---

## 10. Normative v1 decisions

This section closes several design questions for v1.0.

### 10.1 Table separator

The v1 core uses the horizontal tab character (`HTAB`, U+0009) as the table column separator. This is a deliberate tradeoff, not a universal human-ergonomics claim: SDIF-aware tooling must preserve literal tabs, and environments that silently rewrite tabs to spaces can corrupt table rows.

```sdif
items[id,status,owner]:
  item.1	open	team.platform
  item.2	closed	team.platform
```

Reasons:

1. It avoids conflicts with natural-language spaces.
2. It avoids conflicts with comma-rich text.
3. It avoids conflicts with localized decimal commas such as `10,75`.
4. It makes parsing table rows simple and deterministic.
5. It preserves unquoted human-readable text inside cells.
6. It keeps the table model close to TSV, a proven interchange pattern.

A table cell may contain spaces, commas, quotes, slashes, colons, and localized decimal notation without quoting.

```sdif
budget[id,item,cost,tax_rate]:
  IT01	server load	450,25	21,0
  IT02	api calls	120,00	10,5
  IT03	storage fees	85,50	21,0
```

A literal tab inside a cell must be escaped as `\t` in strict mode.

Tabs are reserved for table separation only. They must not be used for indentation.

### 10.2 Rule syntax

The v1 core uses parenthesized expressions.

```sdif
rules:
  (deny missing(evidence))
  (warn eq(authority,Unknown))
```

Reasons:

1. Deterministic parsing.
2. Explicit arity.
3. Clear nesting.
4. Direct AST conversion.
5. Lower ambiguity than whitespace-only rule syntax.

### 10.3 Unquoted strings

The v1 core follows two related policies.

Outside tables:

```text
safe identifier or quoted string
```

A scalar value must be quoted if it contains:

1. Spaces.
2. Commas that are intended as text.
3. Parentheses.
4. Brackets.
5. Quotes.
6. Comment markers.
7. Characters outside the safe identifier rule.

Valid scalar examples:

```sdif
status open
path reports/validation/latest.md
title "Release v2 validation plan"
label "Revenue, monthly"
```

Inside tables, cells are separated by `HTAB`, so ordinary spaces and commas are allowed as raw cell content.

Valid table example:

```sdif
items[id,label,amount]:
  item.1	Release v2 validation plan	450,25
  item.2	Revenue, monthly	120,00
```

A table cell must only escape a literal tab, a line break, or a reserved control character.

### 10.4 Portable conformance before implementation authority

A Tree-sitter grammar is valuable for editor support, syntax highlighting, and incremental parsing. It should not be a detached convenience grammar, and the Python package should not remain the only practical authority for other language implementations.

The portable authority for this specification is the written specification plus the shared `conformance/manifest.sdif` fixture suite. The Python parser under `src/sdif/` is the current reference implementation used to verify those fixtures until independent parser backends are wired into CI.

The sibling `tree-sitter-sdif` repository keeps the v1 tooling package with:

1. `grammar.js` for core SDIF syntax nodes.
2. `tree-sitter.json` for CLI/editor language metadata.
3. `test/corpus/core.txt` for a representative agent-facing SDIF document.
4. `queries/highlights.scm` for editor syntax highlighting.
5. `package.json` scripts for `tree-sitter generate` and `tree-sitter test` when the Tree-sitter CLI is installed.

Tree-sitter support must stay aligned with the official conformance fixtures and must not require agents to use JSON as their working interchange surface. The fixture manifest is SDIF, not JSON, so agents and parser authors can consume the conformance surface directly in the target format.

### 10.5 Canonicalizer from the first implementation slice

The canonicalizer is not a later enhancement. It is part of the first useful SDIF implementation.

Minimum pipeline:

```text
source.sdif -> AST -> canonical AST -> source.sdif.canon -> hash
```

The first milestone is not full semantic validation. The first milestone is stable canonical bytes.

---

## 11. Core grammar — EBNF

This section defines a practical grammar for the SDIF core. It is intended to support the v1 parser, AST, canonicalizer, and basic validator.

### 11.1 Notation

```text
*  zero or more
+  one or more
?  optional
|  alternative
```

Lexical tokens such as `IDENT`, `STRING`, `NUMBER`, and `DATETIME` are defined below.

### 11.2 Document

```ebnf
document        = spacing, statement*, EOF ;

statement       = blank_line
                | comment_line
                | directive_line
                | alias_header
                | field_line
                | object_block
                | table_block
                | relation_block
                | rule_block
                | narrative_block
                ;
```

### 11.3 Base lines

```ebnf
blank_line       = horizontal_space*, newline ;
comment_line     = horizontal_space*, comment, newline ;
comment          = "#", not_newline* ;

newline          = "\n" | "\r\n" ;
horizontal_space = " " | "\t" ;
spacing          = (blank_line | comment_line)* ;
```

In strict mode, tabs must not be accepted as indentation.

### 11.4 Directives

```ebnf
directive_line  = "@", directive_name, directive_args?, inline_comment?, newline ;

directive_name  = IDENT ;
directive_args  = horizontal_space+, value, (horizontal_space+, value)* ;
```

Examples:

```sdif
@sdif 1.0
@profile source
@vocab example.core.v1
```

### 11.5 Scalar fields

```ebnf
field_line      = key, horizontal_space+, value, inline_comment?, newline ;
key             = IDENT ;
```

Examples:

```sdif
kind Plan
id release.v2.plan
schema example.plan.v1
status open
priority P0
```

### 11.6 Objects

```ebnf
object_block       = key, ":", inline_comment?, newline,
                     indented_statement+ ;

indented_statement = INDENT, statement_body, DEDENT? ;
statement_body     = field_line
                   | object_block
                   | table_block
                   | relation_block
                   | rule_block
                   | narrative_block
                   | comment_line
                   | blank_line
                   ;
```

`INDENT` and `DEDENT` may be synthetic tokens generated by the lexer.

### 11.7 Inline lists

```ebnf
list            = "[", list_items?, "]" ;
list_items      = value, (",", value)* ;
```

Example:

```sdif
tags [registry,validation,release]
```

### 11.8 Tables

```ebnf
table_block     = table_header, table_row+ ;

table_header    = key, "[", column_list, "]", ":", inline_comment?, newline ;
column_list     = column, (",", column)* ;
column          = IDENT, ["$"] ;
alias_header    = "alias", "[", alias_entry, (",", alias_entry)*, "]", inline_comment?, newline ;
alias_entry     = IDENT, "=", IDENT ;

table_row       = INDENT, table_cell, (HTAB, table_cell)*, inline_comment?, newline ;
ai_table_row    = table_cell, HTAB, table_cell, (HTAB, table_cell)*, inline_comment?, newline ;
table_cell      = table_cell_char* ;
table_cell_char = any_char_except_htab_or_newline ;
HTAB            = ? U+0009 horizontal tab ? ;
```

Required semantic rules:

1. Each row must contain exactly the same number of cells as the table header declares.
2. `HTAB` is the only column separator in table rows.
3. Ordinary spaces inside cells are preserved as data.
4. Commas inside cells are preserved as data.
5. Quote marks inside cells are preserved as data unless an implementation chooses to support optional quoted-cell decoding.
6. A column name ending in `$` is a `.sdif.ai` string-preserved column marker; consumers must strip the suffix from the semantic column name and parse all cells in that column as strings.
7. Canonical SDIF rows use `INDENT`; `.sdif.ai` rows may use `ai_table_row` only when the row contains `HTAB`.
8. A `.sdif.ai` alias header uses `compact=semantic` entries and is preserved by canonicalization before data statements.
9. A literal tab inside a cell must be escaped as `\t` in strict mode.
10. Empty cells are syntactically valid raw cells in the reference parser; schemas may reject them through future validation policy.
11. Multiline blocks are not valid inside tables in v1.
12. Inline comments inside tables are prohibited in strict mode.

Example:

```sdif
milestones[id,status,gate,evidence]:
  R1	done	validate-syntax	reports/syntax.md
  R2	pending	validate-schema	reports/schema.md
```

### 11.9 Relations

```ebnf
relation_block  = "rel", ":", inline_comment?, newline, relation_row+ ;
relation_row    = INDENT, relation_subject, horizontal_space+, relation_predicate,
                  horizontal_space+, relation_object, inline_comment?, newline ;

relation_subject   = IDENTIFIER_VALUE ;
relation_predicate = IDENTIFIER_VALUE ;
relation_object    = IDENTIFIER_VALUE | STRING ;
```

Example:

```sdif
rel:
  release.v2 depends_on release.v1
  release.v2 validated_by validation.report.v2
```

In v1 source, a relation has exactly three parts: subject, predicate, and object. In `.sdif.ai`, `rel[subject]:` is also accepted as subject-grouped compact syntax; each row then contains exactly predicate and object and expands back to ordinary relation triples. The grouped form is rejected in `@sdif` source documents.

### 11.10 Rules

```ebnf
rule_block      = "rules", ":", inline_comment?, newline, rule_row+ ;
rule_row        = INDENT, expression, inline_comment?, newline ;

expression      = "(", action_name, horizontal_space+, condition, ")" ;
action_name     = "deny" | "warn" ;
condition       = compact_call | IDENT ;
compact_call    = function_name, "(", (value | compact_call), (",", (value | compact_call))* , ")" ;
function_name   = IDENT ;
expression_arg  = horizontal_space+, (value | expression) ;
```

Examples:

```sdif
rules:
  (deny missing(evidence))
  (warn eq(authority,Unknown))
  (deny all(missing(schema) missing(kind)))
```

`missing(evidence)` may be treated as compact call syntax and normalized in the AST.

Recommended internal representation:

```text
Call(name="deny", args=[Call(name="missing", args=[Identifier("evidence")])])
```

### 11.11 Narrative blocks

```ebnf
narrative_block   = key, horizontal_space+, multiline_string, inline_comment?, newline? ;
multiline_string  = "\"\"\"", multiline_content, "\"\"\"" ;
multiline_content = any_char_until_triple_quote* ;
```

Example:

```sdif
intent """
Define validation requirements for the next release.
Preserve reproducibility and auditability.
"""
```

### 11.12 Values

```ebnf
value           = null
                | boolean
                | datetime
                | date
                | duration
                | number
                | string
                | list
                | identifier_value
                ;

scalar_value    = null
                | boolean
                | datetime
                | date
                | duration
                | number
                | string
                | identifier_value
                ;

null            = "null" ;
boolean         = "true" | "false" ;
```

### 11.13 Lexical tokens

```ebnf
IDENT           = IDENT_START, IDENT_CONT* ;
IDENT_START     = "A".."Z" | "a".."z" | "_" ;
IDENT_CONT      = IDENT_START | "0".."9" | "-" ;

identifier_value = IDENTIFIER_CHAR+ ;
IDENTIFIER_CHAR  = "A".."Z"
                 | "a".."z"
                 | "0".."9"
                 | "_"
                 | "-"
                 | "."
                 | "/"
                 | ":"
                 ;

number          = integer | decimal | scientific ;
integer         = sign?, digit+ ;
decimal         = sign?, digit+, ".", digit+ ;
scientific      = sign?, digit+, ("." digit+)?, ("e" | "E"), sign?, digit+ ;
sign            = "+" | "-" ;
digit           = "0".."9" ;

string          = quoted_string ;
quoted_string   = "\"", quoted_char*, "\"" ;
quoted_char     = escaped_char | normal_string_char ;
escaped_char    = "\\", ("\\" | "\"" | "n" | "r" | "t" | "u", hex, hex, hex, hex) ;

normal_string_char = any_char_except_quote_backslash_newline ;

inline_comment  = horizontal_space+, "#", not_newline* ;
```

### 11.14 Dates, times, and durations

```ebnf
date            = digit, digit, digit, digit, "-", digit, digit, "-", digit, digit ;

datetime        = date, "T", digit, digit, ":", digit, digit, ":", digit, digit,
                  fractional_seconds?, timezone ;

fractional_seconds = ".", digit+ ;
timezone        = "Z" | sign, digit, digit, ":", digit, digit ;

duration        = "P", duration_body ;
duration_body   = IDENTIFIER_CHAR+ ;
```

The grammar recognizes shape. Semantic validation should verify actual calendar validity.

### 11.15 Type precedence

When an unquoted token could match multiple types, the following precedence applies:

1. `null`
2. boolean
3. datetime
4. date
5. duration
6. number
7. identifier value

Example:

```sdif
value 2026-05-20
```

This is a date.

```sdif
value "2026-05-20"
```

This is a string.

---

## 12. Minimum normative AST

The v1 Python reference implementation produces an AST independent from source comments and blank-line trivia. It is deliberately string-preserving at parse time; semantic typing is applied later by validators and converters.

### 12.1 Document

```text
Document
  directives: Directive[]
  statements: Statement[]
```

### 12.2 Statements

```text
Statement
  Field(key: string, value: string, quoted: bool)
  ObjectBlock(key: string, statements: Statement[])
  Table(name: string, columns: string[], rows: string[][], quoted_columns: set<int>)
  Relation(subject: string, predicate: string, object: string, object_quoted: bool)
  Rule(source: string, expression: RuleExpression?)
  Narrative(key: string, text: string)
```

Comments may exist in a source-preserving AST, but they must not be part of the canonical AST.

### 12.3 Values

```text
ParsedValue = string
Quotedness metadata is preserved for scalar fields, relation objects, and table columns restored from `.sdif.ai` `$` markers.
```

The schema validator recognizes `Null`, `Boolean`, `Integer`, `Decimal`, `String`, `Identifier`, `Path`, `Date`, `DateTime`, `Duration`, `Enum(...)`, and `List<T>` after parsing. Decimal validation accepts plain integers and fixed-point decimals; scientific notation and decimal normalization are deferred.

### 12.4 Tables

```text
Table
  name: string
  columns: Vec<string>
  rows: Vec<Vec<string>>
  quoted_columns: Set<int>
```

### 12.5 Relations

```text
Relation
  subject: Identifier
  predicate: Identifier
  object: RelationObject

RelationObject
  Identifier(string)
  String(string)
```

### 12.6 Expressions

```text
Expression
  Call { name: Identifier, args: Vec<ExpressionArg> }

ExpressionArg
  Value(Value)
  Call(Expression)
```

---

## 13. Schemas

An SDIF schema defines the expected shape and semantics of a document.

### 13.1 Schema responsibilities

A schema should define:

1. Document kind through a required `kind` field and/or an `Enum(...)` field type.
2. Required fields.
3. Optional fields.
4. Field types.
5. Defaults as schema metadata for tools; the current validator does not materialize default values.
6. Enumerations.
7. Allowed tables.
8. Required columns.
9. Allowed relation predicates.
10. Allowed rule functions.
11. Alias policy as a future schema-governed extension; the current parser enforces only reserved-term and collision checks.
12. Whether table row order is semantically significant.
13. Canonicalization policy.

### 13.2 Minimal schema example

A schema may itself be written in SDIF.

```sdif
@sdif 1.0
kind Schema
id example.plan.v1
schema sdif.schema.v1
authority Canonical
lifecycle Active

for_kind Plan

fields[name,type,required,default]:
  kind	Enum(Plan)	true	null
  id	Identifier	true	null
  schema	Identifier	true	null
  authority	Enum(Canonical,Reference,Working,Derived,External,Unknown)	false	Unknown
  lifecycle	Enum(Draft,Active,Deprecated,Superseded,Archived,Quarantined)	false	Draft
  title	String	true	null
  status	Enum(open,closed,blocked)	true	open
  priority	Enum(P0,P1,P2,P3)	false	P2

tables[name,ordered,primary_key]:
  milestones	true	id
  scope	false	in

columns[table,name,type,required]:
  milestones	id	Identifier	true
  milestones	status	Enum(done,pending,blocked)	true
  milestones	gate	Identifier	false
  milestones	evidence	Path	false
  scope	in	Identifier	true
  scope	out	Identifier	true

relations[predicate,subject_type,object_type,required]:
  depends_on	Identifier	Identifier	false
  validated_by	Identifier	Identifier	false
  governed_by	Identifier	Identifier	false
  emits	Identifier	Path	false

rule_functions[name,min_args,max_args]:
  missing	1	1
  dangling	1	1
  invalid	1	1
  unknown	1	1
  eq	2	2
```

### 13.3 v1 schema types

Minimum recommended schema types:

```text
Null
Boolean
Integer
Decimal
String
Identifier
Path
Date
DateTime
Duration
Enum(...)
List<T>
```

Types outside v1:

```text
Union
Map
Regex
Object<T>
ExternalRef
RemoteSchema
```

### 13.4 Duplicate handling

Recommended v1 rules:

1. A root-level scalar field must not repeat unless the schema declares it as accumulative.
2. A table must not repeat unless explicitly allowed by schema.
3. A `rel:` block may repeat and concatenate.
4. A `rules:` block may repeat and concatenate.
5. Object blocks must not repeat unless explicitly allowed.

---

## 14. Validation pipeline

SDIF validation should happen in phases.

### 14.1 Lexing

Checks:

* Valid UTF-8.
* Valid tokens.
* Closed strings.
* Valid comment placement.
* Normalizable line endings.

### 14.2 Parsing

Builds an AST.

Checks:

* Valid indentation.
* Closed blocks.
* Well-formed tables.
* Correct table cell count.
* Relations with exactly three parts.
* Balanced expressions.

### 14.3 Normalization

Resolves:

* Aliases.
* Defaults as schema metadata; the current validator does not fill missing defaulted fields.
* Type recognition.
* Namespaces.
* Includes, if enabled.
* Base URIs, if enabled.

### 14.4 Schema validation

Checks:

* Required fields.
* Types.
* Enumerations.
* Allowed tables.
* Required columns.
* Allowed relation predicates.
* Allowed rule functions.

### 14.5 Semantic validation

Checks may include:

* Dangling relations.
* Missing evidence.
* Forbidden cycles.
* Invalid lifecycle transitions.
* Duplicate semantic identifiers.
* Inconsistency between fields and relations.

### 14.6 Rule evaluation

Declarative rules may produce:

* `pass`
* `warn`
* `deny`
* `error`

A validator must distinguish:

* `deny`: the document was understood, but a policy rejected it.
* `error`: the document could not be processed correctly.

---

## 15. Canonicalization

Canonicalization converts SDIF Source into SDIF Canonical.

### 15.1 Goals

Canonical SDIF must be:

1. Deterministic.
2. Stable.
3. Comment-free.
4. Unambiguous.
5. Suitable for hashing.
6. Suitable for signing.
7. Suitable for byte-for-byte comparison.

### 15.2 Recommended rules

The canonicalizer should:

1. Use UTF-8 without BOM.
2. Use LF line endings.
3. Use two-space indentation.
4. Remove comments.
5. Remove redundant blank lines.
6. Order directives deterministically.
7. Order fields according to schema policy.
8. Escape strings consistently.
9. Sort relations when order is not significant.
10. Sort table rows when order is not significant.
11. Preserve order when the schema declares order significant.

The v1.0 core intentionally does not yet normalize aliases, booleans beyond parser-preserved literals, null spellings, dates, date-times, or numeric representation as semantic equivalence classes. Those policies require explicit versioning and golden fixtures.

### 15.3 Hashing

The hash should be calculated over canonical bytes.

```text
sha256(sdif_canonical_bytes)
```

### 15.4 Signing

Signatures should be applied to canonical bytes, not to source text, unless the source text is itself canonical.

---

## 16. JSON mapping

SDIF should map conceptually to JSON.

### 16.1 Scalar field

SDIF:

```sdif
status open
```

JSON:

```json
{
  "status": "open"
}
```

### 16.2 Object

SDIF:

```sdif
owner:
  id team.platform
  role maintainer
```

JSON:

```json
{
  "owner": {
    "id": "team.platform",
    "role": "maintainer"
  }
}
```

### 16.3 Table

SDIF:

```sdif
items[id,status]:
  item.1	open
  item.2	closed
```

JSON:

```json
{
  "items": [
    { "id": "item.1", "status": "open" },
    { "id": "item.2", "status": "closed" }
  ]
}
```

### 16.4 Relations

SDIF:

```sdif
rel:
  a depends_on b
```

Recommended JSON:

```json
{
  "rel": [
    { "subject": "a", "predicate": "depends_on", "object": "b" }
  ]
}
```

### 16.5 Rules

SDIF:

```sdif
rules:
  (deny missing(evidence))
```

Current reference JSON projection:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    "(deny missing(evidence))"
  ]
}
```

A structured rule-AST JSON shape is a possible future extension, but the current converter preserves rule rows as source strings.

### 16.6 Heterogeneous lists

To represent heterogeneous or nested lists in JSON without expanding the core SDIF source grammar with list-of-block syntax, SDIF uses a reserved repeated `__item` object block convention. A scalar value inside a nested list is wrapped in a field named `__value`.

This mapping is a technical projection for JSON interoperability and is not the preferred syntax for human-authored SDIF documents.

SDIF:

```sdif
list:
  __item:
    __value item1
  __item:
    key value
```

JSON:

```json
{
  "list": [
    "item1",
    {
      "key": "value"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## 17. Comparison with other formats

### 17.1 JSON

JSON is universal and excellent for APIs. SDIF is more compact for repeated structured data and more expressive for semantic documents.

### 17.2 YAML

YAML is human-friendly but highly flexible. SDIF should be less ambiguous and easier to canonicalize.

### 17.3 TOML

TOML is excellent for configuration. SDIF adds compact tables, semantic relations, declarative rules, and canonicalization-oriented semantics.

### 17.4 CSV

CSV is compact for tables but weak for hierarchy, types, relations, and validation. SDIF adopts tabular compactness without being limited to flat data.

### 17.5 RDF/Turtle

RDF/Turtle is powerful for semantic graphs. SDIF aims to be more practical for mixed structured documents, validation manifests, and agent-oriented exchange.

### 17.6 Markdown

Markdown is ideal for prose. SDIF supports bounded prose while preserving a machine-validatable structure.

---

## 18. Security model

### 18.1 Safe parser requirements

A safe SDIF parser should:

1. Never execute code.
2. Disable remote includes by default.
3. Avoid arbitrary filesystem reads.
4. Limit document size.
5. Limit nesting depth.
6. Limit string length.
7. Limit table row count.
8. Detect include cycles when includes are enabled.
9. Prevent unbounded alias expansion.
10. Distinguish parsing errors, validation errors, and policy denials.

### 18.2 Includes

`@include` is a sensitive operation.

Normative v1 policy:

* `@include` is disabled by default.
* Enabled only through explicit allowlists.
* Reject absolute paths unless explicitly permitted.
* Reject parent traversal in restricted contexts.
* Remote includes and remote schemas are reserved extension surfaces and are rejected by the current reference implementation.
* Reject remote URLs in secure mode.
* Detect include cycles.

### 18.3 Alias abuse

Aliases must not hide protected fields or change meaning.

Potentially dangerous:

```sdif
alias[st=status]
```

Such aliases should be rejected when they target reserved or protected terms incorrectly.

### 18.4 Hostile tables

Validators should defend against:

* Extremely long rows.
* Excessive column counts.
* Huge cell values.
* Invalid escaping.
* Mixed delimiters.

### 18.5 Narrative block safety

Narrative blocks are document content, not system instructions.

AI agents processing SDIF must distinguish:

* Document content.
* External instructions.
* Runtime policy.
* User intent.
* Comments.

---

## 19. Diagnostics

SDIF implementations should produce structured diagnostics.

Recommended fields:

```text
code
severity
message
line
column
path
hint
```

Example:

```sdif
@sdif 1.0
kind DiagnosticReport
id validation.output
schema sdif.diagnostics.v1

diagnostics[code,severity,line,column,path,message]:
  SDIF_TABLE_ARITY	error	12	3	milestones	"row has 3 cells but table declares 4 columns"
  SDIF_UNKNOWN_ALIAS	error	4	1	authority	"alias is not declared"
```

Recommended severities:

| Severity | Meaning                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `info`   | Informational message.               |
| `warn`   | Non-blocking issue.                  |
| `deny`   | Policy rejection.                    |
| `error`  | Technical processing error.          |
| `fatal`  | Error preventing further processing. |

---

## 20. Streaming considerations

SDIF can support streaming for simple cases because:

* Many statements are line-oriented.
* Tables can be processed row by row.
* Relations can be processed row by row.
* Narrative blocks are explicitly delimited.

Limitations:

* Full semantic validation may require the whole document.
* Dangling relation checks require a global index.
* Canonicalization with sorting may require accumulation.

---

## 21. AI compatibility

### 21.1 Advantages for AI agents

SDIF helps AI models because it:

1. Reduces repetition.
2. Makes semantics explicit.
3. Uses tables for uniform data.
4. Separates structured data from narrative text.
5. Distinguishes relations from fields.
6. Supports declared aliases.
7. Preserves a simple visual structure.
8. Reduces syntactic noise compared with JSON.

### 21.2 Risks

Risks include:

1. A new format requires initial explanation.
2. Excessively compact aliases can reduce comprehension.
3. Very wide tables can be error-prone.
4. Rule expressions require a known vocabulary.
5. Narrative blocks may be confused with instructions if not handled carefully.

### 21.3 Mitigations

1. Use clear aliases.
2. Keep table headers descriptive.
3. Avoid very wide tables.
4. Put `kind`, `id`, and `schema` near the top.
5. Prefer simple relation predicates.
6. Use a small set of rule functions in v1.
7. Treat `.sdif.ai` as a generated view.

## 25. Implementation components

The current Python reference implementation includes a parser, AST, canonicalizer/serializer, SHA-256 hashing, schema validator, JSON converter, `.sdif.ai` projector/reverser, policy checks, and structured validation diagnostics. A fuller multi-language ecosystem may add a separate lexer, richer normalizer, semantic rule evaluator, signing layer, and deeper diagnostic source mapping.

### 25.1 Reference AST

```text
Document(directives, statements)
Directive(name, args)
Field(key, value, quoted=False)
ObjectBlock(key, statements)
Table(name, columns, rows, quoted_columns=frozenset())
Relation(subject, predicate, object, object_quoted=False)
Rule(source, expression=None)
Narrative(key, text)
```

### 25.2 Reference value handling

```text
Parser values: string-preserving
Validation values: interpreted by schema type
JSON conversion values: converted to JSON-compatible scalars, arrays, objects, relations, and rule-source strings
```

---

## 26. v1 scope

The first useful SDIF implementation supports:

1. `@sdif` and `@sdif.ai` directives.
2. Scalar fields.
3. Indented objects.
4. Inline lists.
5. Tables.
6. `rel:` blocks.
7. `rules:` blocks with parenthesized expressions.
8. Narrative blocks.
9. Source comments.
10. Table arity validation.
11. Basic schema validation.
12. JSON conversion.
13. Basic canonicalization.
14. `.sdif.ai` projection and reversal to canonical source.
15. Local includes behind explicit parser policy.

Out of scope for v1:

1. Remote includes.
2. Complex namespaces.
3. Deep graph validation.
4. Digital signatures.
5. Remote schemas.
6. Advanced type unions.
7. Rule execution beyond declarative validation.
8. Semantic normalization beyond canonical syntax, such as alias-equivalence hashing or numeric/date equivalence classes.

### 26.1 v1 acceptance criteria

The v1 contract proves this pipeline:

```text
source.sdif or source.sdif.ai -> AST -> canonical bytes -> stable hash
```

Minimum acceptance criteria:

1. Valid syntax fixtures parse deterministically.
2. Invalid syntax fixtures fail with stable diagnostics.
3. Equivalent source fixtures produce identical canonical bytes.
4. Equivalent source fixtures produce identical SHA-256 hashes.
5. Table arity errors are detected.
6. Required fields are detected through a minimal schema.
7. Relations with invalid arity are rejected.
8. Rule expressions must be balanced and parseable.

## 28. Versioning policy

### 28.1 Format version

The `@sdif` directive declares the format version. This format version (e.g. `@sdif 1.0`) represents the syntax and semantic contract of the format, and is versioned independently of any specific parser, tool, or library package implementation version (e.g., Python package version `1.0.0`).

```sdif
@sdif 1.0
```

Compatible changes may include:

* New optional directives.
* New optional profiles.
* New opt-in rule functions.
* New schema-level capabilities.

Incompatible changes include:

* Changing the meaning of existing syntax.
* Changing canonicalization rules without versioning.
* Changing scalar type precedence.
* Changing base rule semantics.

### 28.2 Schema version

Schemas are versioned independently.

```sdif
schema example.plan.v1
```

A new schema version may impose stricter validation while the SDIF format version remains unchanged.

---

## 29. Style recommendations

### 29.1 Recommended document order

Suggested source order:

1. `@sdif` directive.
2. Profile and vocabulary directives.
3. `kind`.
4. `id`.
5. `schema`.
6. `authority`.
7. `lifecycle`.
8. Timestamps.
9. Title and summary.
10. Main fields.
11. Tables.
12. Relations.
13. Rules.
14. Long narrative blocks when not critical at the top.

### 29.2 Naming

Use `snake_case` for keys:

```sdif
created_at 2026-05-20T18:00:00Z
```

Use dot notation for hierarchical identifiers:

```sdif
id release.v2.validation_plan
```

Use kebab-case for human-readable slugs when appropriate:

```sdif
tag schema-validation
```

### 29.3 Tables

Keep tables reasonably narrow.

If a table exceeds 8 to 10 columns, consider splitting it.

### 29.4 Relations

Prefer clear predicates over excessively short aliases.

Good:

```sdif
release.v2 depends_on release.v1
```

Too cryptic for source documents:

```sdif
v2 dep v1
```

Compact aliases may be appropriate in `.sdif.ai`, but source documents should favor clarity.

---

## 30. Deferred extension decisions

The stable 1.0 core fixes the normative behavior above; the topics below are deferred extensions, not part of the v1 contract.

### 30.1 Inline comments in tables

Allowing inline comments inside table rows improves human authoring but complicates parsing and canonicalization, especially when table cells may contain ordinary spaces and punctuation.

For the v1.0 stabilization track, strict mode prohibits inline comments inside table rows. Implementations may accept them only in tolerant source-preserving modes, and they must never become part of the canonical AST.

### 30.2 Table cell typing

Because table cells are separated by `HTAB`, a raw cell may contain spaces, commas, quotes, and localized decimal notation.

Table cells are captured as raw strings in the initial AST.
Schema-driven typing is applied during validation or normalization, not during raw parsing. This avoids premature
misclassification of localized numbers such as `450,25`.

For `.sdif.ai`, a generated table header may suffix a column with `$` to make
that preservation explicit in the compact surface. The `$` suffix is a decoding hint only and is not part of the semantic column name. It lets agents and parsers read
scalar-like cells as strings without repeated per-cell quote characters.

### 30.3 Namespace design

The v1 namespace form is `@namespace prefix iri`. Complex namespace behavior is a versioned extension.

Normative form:

```sdif
@namespace ex https://example.org/ns#
```

### 30.4 Includes

Includes are useful but security-sensitive.

For v1, `@include` is disabled by default and may be enabled only through explicit policy. Local includes require allowlists. Remote includes and remote schemas are reserved extension surfaces and are rejected by the current reference implementation. Include resolution must detect cycles.

### 30.5 Rule expression syntax

The v1 core uses compact parenthesized expressions, but the exact internal normalization should be specified more formally.

For example:

```sdif
(deny missing(evidence))
```

could normalize to:

```text
RuleExpression(action, function, args)
RuleExpression("deny", "missing", [Identifier("evidence")])
```

### 30.6 Canonical table ordering

Schemas should explicitly declare whether table row order is significant.

Deferred extension decision: future profiles may define additional default ordering policies beyond the v1 schema-driven rule.

---

## 31. Conclusion

SDIF is a compact, schema-governed semantic data interchange format for AI agents and deterministic machine workflows, with human-auditable source files.

Its value is not that it is merely shorter than JSON or cleaner than YAML. Its value is the combination of four properties that rarely appear together:

1. Agent-first compactness with human auditability.
2. Token efficiency.
3. Explicit semantics.
4. Strong validation and canonicalization.

The core idea:

```text
SDIF = JSON-like data + compact tables + semantic triples + declarative rules + canonical form
```

The first implementation should avoid trying to support every possible feature. It should prove the essential technical spine:

```text
source.sdif or source.sdif.ai -> AST -> canonical bytes -> stable hash
```

Once that pipeline is stable, schema validation, semantic validation, editor tooling, AI-optimized views, signing, and advanced vocabularies can evolve on top of a solid foundation.

---

## Appendix A. Python reference implementation notes

The repository implementation follows the portable conformance spine defined above:

```text
source.sdif or source.sdif.ai -> AST -> canonical bytes -> sha256 hash
```

### CLI

The current CLI entry point is `sdif` after installation, or `python tools/sdif-cli.py` from a checkout.

```bash
sdif parse examples/plan.sdif
sdif canon examples/plan.sdif
sdif hash examples/plan.sdif
sdif validate examples/plan.sdif --schema examples/schema.sdif
sdif tokens examples/plan.sdif
sdif to-json examples/plan.sdif
sdif from-json document.json
sdif ai examples/plan.sdif --alias kind=k --alias status=st
sdif from-ai examples/plan.sdif.ai
sdif inspect examples/plan.sdif --json
sdif fmt examples/plan.sdif --check
```

`sdif tokens` emits `bytes=<n> tokenizer=<name> tokens=<n>`. The v1 CLI uses
`tiktoken/cl100k_base` when the optional `tiktoken` dependency is available and
falls back to `estimate/4bytes` otherwise. The benchmark script remains the
authoritative multi-format comparison surface.

The repository benchmark derives JSON compact, JSON pretty, YAML, XML, CSV
Bundle, SDIF, SDIF AI, and optionally TOON from the same canonical JSON fixture
source. `SDIF AI` is produced from the generated SDIF document with the
`.sdif.ai` projection so the benchmark tracks the AI-context surface separately
from canonical SDIF. For benchmark fairness, that projection chooses the smaller
of a headerless context-window view and an explicit alias-header view; aliases
are only useful when their decoding header pays for itself. The projection also
uses compact table rows and `$` string-preserved columns when those choices
reduce repeated syntax without changing semantics. It always reports an
`Estimate` column using the same deterministic 4-UTF-8-bytes-per-token fallback
as `sdif tokens`, and uses `tiktoken` as the primary ordering and ratio metric
when that optional dependency is installed. `CSV Bundle` is intentionally named
as a bundle because a full semantic SDIF document may contain metadata, nested
values, relations, and rules that cannot fit in a single honest flat CSV table.

### AST model

The v1 AST is intentionally small and source-independent:

* `Document(directives, statements)`
* `Directive(name, args)`
* `Field(key, value, quoted=False)`
* `ObjectBlock(key, statements)`
* `Table(name, columns, rows, quoted_columns=frozenset())`
* `Relation(subject, predicate, object, object_quoted=False)`
* `Rule(source, expression=None)`
* `Narrative(key, text)`

Comments are accepted in source but excluded from the canonical AST and canonical output.

### Canonicalization rules implemented in v1

The current canonical serializer:

1. Normalizes line endings to LF through parser input normalization.
2. Removes comments and blank source-only trivia.
3. Emits directives in deterministic reserved-directive order.
4. Emits common metadata fields in deterministic order before other statements.
5. Preserves table rows with literal `HTAB` separators.
6. Emits a final trailing newline.
7. Hashes SHA-256 over canonical UTF-8 bytes.

Schema-aware canonicalization now supports table row ordering through `tables[name,ordered,primary_key]`: unordered tables with a declared primary key are sorted by that key when a schema is provided. Relations and rules are sorted deterministically. Alias expansion, numeric normalization, date-time equivalence, and semantic merging remain future versioned policies.

### Validation CLI and diagnostics

The v1 validator can load an SDIF schema document and emit either text output or structured JSON diagnostics.

```bash
sdif validate examples/plan.sdif --schema examples/schema.sdif
sdif validate examples/plan.sdif --schema examples/schema.sdif --json
```

The `--schema` argument must parse as an SDIF document with `kind Schema`.
Malformed schema tables fail before validation with an `invalid --schema`
message instead of a Python traceback.

Structured diagnostics use this shape:

```json
{
  "valid": false,
  "diagnostics": [
    {
      "code": "SDIF_REQUIRED_FIELD",
      "severity": "error",
      "message": "missing required field: id",
      "path": "id",
      "hint": "add `id` to the document"
    }
  ]
}
```

### JSON conversion scope

The v1 JSON converter supports scalar fields, nested objects, uniform arrays as SDIF tables, `rel` arrays as relation blocks, `rules` arrays as rule-source strings, scalar lists as inline SDIF lists, and heterogeneous or nested arrays through the reserved repeated `__item` / `__value` object-block convention. Quoted scalar markers and `.sdif.ai` `$` table columns are used to preserve JSON string semantics for values that otherwise look like `null`, booleans, numbers, or lists.
