# JSON vs YAML vs TOON vs XML vs CSV vs SDIF

## Summary

| Format | Strength | Weakness | SDIF position |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JSON | Universal API interchange and simple data model | Verbose repeated keys; comments absent; canonicalization is external policy | SDIF keeps JSON-like structure but reduces repetition and adds semantic blocks |
| YAML | Human-friendly configuration | Large grammar, implicit typing surprises, many equivalent spellings | SDIF intentionally narrows syntax for deterministic parsing and canonicalization |
| TOON | Token-efficient object/table notation for LLM contexts | Primarily optimized for compact transfer, not semantic validation or canonical hashes | SDIF adopts table compactness but adds relations, rules, profiles, schemas, canonical bytes |
| XML | Mature document markup, namespaces, schemas, mixed content | Very tag-heavy for repeated machine data; noisy for LLM context windows | SDIF keeps explicit structure while avoiding repeated open/close tags for table-like data |
| CSV/TSV | Extremely compact for a single flat table | Cannot represent nested objects, metadata, relations, or rule blocks without an external bundle convention | SDIF preserves CSV-like row density but embeds table meaning, fields, relations, and rules in one document |
| SDIF | Semantic density, tabular compaction, relationships, declarative rules, canonicalization | New ecosystem; narrower v1 core; requires SDIF-aware tooling | Best fit for auditable semantic documents and AI-agent exchange |

## Repeated records

JSON repeats keys for every row:

```json
[
  {"id":"R1","status":"done","gate":"syntax"},
  {"id":"R2","status":"pending","gate":"schema"}
]
```

YAML is easier to read but still repeats keys:

```yaml
- id: R1
  status: done
  gate: syntax
- id: R2
  status: pending
  gate: schema
```

TOON compacts repeated object keys by declaring a tabular shape for LLM transfer:

```toon
[2]{id,status,gate}:
  R1,done,syntax
  R2,pending,schema
```

XML is explicit but repeats tags around every value:

```xml
<milestones>
  <item>
    <id>R1</id>
    <status>done</status>
    <gate>syntax</gate>
  </item>
  <item>
    <id>R2</id>
    <status>pending</status>
    <gate>schema</gate>
  </item>
</milestones>
```

CSV is compact for this one table, but needs external context to say what table
it belongs to and cannot carry document metadata, relationships, and rules in
the same flat file without a bundle convention:

```csv
id,status,gate
R1,done,syntax
R2,pending,schema
```

SDIF uses a table shape once, then literal `HTAB` separated cells, and the same document can also include relations, rules, schemas, and canonical hashes:

```sdif
milestones[id,status,gate]:
  R1	done	syntax
  R2	pending	schema
```

## Semantic relationships

JSON/YAML can encode relationships, but they do not reserve a compact semantic relation block. SDIF does:

```sdif
rel:
  R2 depends_on R1
  validation.report.v2 validates release.v2.validation_plan
```

## Canonicalization

SDIF treats canonicalization as core behavior rather than an afterthought:

1. Remove comments and redundant blank lines.
2. Normalize line endings to LF.
3. Emit deterministic directives and statements.
4. Hash the canonical bytes with SHA-256.

## When not to use SDIF

Use JSON for public APIs that already require JSON. Use YAML/TOML for simple local configuration where canonical hashes, semantic relations, and compact repeated records do not matter. Use XML when existing document-markup tooling, namespaces, or mixed-content workflows dominate. Use CSV/TSV for plain flat tables.

## Benchmark coverage

`sdif-benchmarks/scripts/token_efficiency.py` derives every compared representation from the
same canonical JSON fixture and currently includes JSON compact, JSON pretty,
YAML, XML, a practical CSV bundle, SDIF, SDIF AI, and TOON when the official
TOON CLI is available. `SDIF AI` applies the `.sdif.ai` projection to the
generated SDIF document so token metrics include the AI-context surface
separately from canonical SDIF. The benchmark keeps that projection compact by
choosing the smaller of a headerless context-window view and an explicit
alias-header view. The benchmark always includes an `Estimate` token column
using a deterministic 4-UTF-8-bytes-per-token fallback, while `tiktoken` remains
the preferred primary metric when installed. External tokenizers such as Llama3
and Claude are strictly opt-in via environment variables to avoid unnecessary network
access or heavy dependencies. The benchmark writes a summary report in SDIF format under
`sdif-benchmarks/results/token_efficiency/summary.sdif` (which is ignored by version control). The CSV
output is named `CSV Bundle` because nested SDIF documents cannot be represented honestly
as a single flat CSV table.
